# coreXY 3d printer
A coreXY 3d printer involves a gantry where the x and y axes move, and a vertical z axis. This configuration of 3d printer is superior to traditional "bed slinger" printers where the y and z axes are attatched to each other, inducing stress on the system as the z axis has to lift the heavy toolead. A coreXY alleviates this issue by moving z axis independently from the x and y, allowing for longer printer lifespan and faster prints.

# Starter Project

My starter project used the Arduino starter kit, and is a small trashcan whose lid opens when a ultrasonic sensor detects an object within 10 cm of it. When it triggers, a servo turns to the 90 degree position, functioning as the lid. The servo will remain in the 90 degree position until the object is no longer within a certain threshold. I used Onshape to model a box and a lid, and printed them out. I also routed most of the wiring inside the box for aesthetic purposes. For the circuit itself, I created a prototype on a breadboard, and after testing my code on it, I transferred the wiring to a protoshield. 

My project was programmed in the Arduino IDE, and involves a while loop that runs if there is an object within the distance threshold, checking every 100 milliseconds. If the while loop triggers, it triggers the servo to move to the 90 degree position, and then refreshes its value for the distance to the object. Once the loop stops running, the servo is programmed to return to the neutral position.

I experienced some trouble while using the Arduino IDE. As I am familiar with other programming languages such as java and python, I assumed that the "output" window on the IDE was its console, so when I was looking for the values my code was supposed to be outputting, I couldnt find anything on the output. I thought that it was a software issue, so I spent a long time searching for a bug. However, I eventually discovered the "Serial Console", which was where my values were being output.
# Code

```c++
#include <Servo.h>

#define echoPin 12
#define trigPin 11
// choose pin for the buzzer
int servoPin = 9;      // Servo Pin
int distanceThreshold = 10;

Servo Servo1;             // creating servo object

void setup() {
  Serial.begin (9600);
  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT); // Set trigPin as OUTPUT
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);  // Set echoPin as INPUT
  Servo1.attach(servoPin);  // attaching servo pin
}

void loop() {
  long duration, distance;
  
  // Send a pulse to trigPin
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW); 
  delayMicroseconds(2); 
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10); 
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  
  duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
  distance = (duration / 2) / 29.1;

  Serial.print(distance);
  Serial.print(" ");

  while (distance < distanceThreshold){
    Servo1.write(90);
 
    Serial.print("something happened! ");
    digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW); 
    delayMicroseconds(2); 
    digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
    delayMicroseconds(10); 
    digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
    duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
    distance = (duration / 2) / 29.1;
    delay(500);
  }

    Servo1.write(0);

  delay(1000);
}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
